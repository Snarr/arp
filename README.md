# Auto Refresh Plus (arp) w/ Webhook Support!

I modified the original "arp" repo to now send a Webhook GET request to any URL of your desire.
Use this to link the page monitor feature to services like IFTTT. This allows for unique connections like calling your phone once your query is found.

# How to install 

**Manually**
From the Chrome extensions page, tick the "Developer mode" checkbox and then
"Load unpacked extension...". From that file dialog, pick the folder where
you've checked out this source tree.

**Contributions**
If you want to submit a contribution, please just fork the project, do the fix, and submit a merge request! I will be more than happy to add you to the list of contributors and push the updated version to the Chrome Web Store. Thanks!
